   * add as_vector with default value of TRUE for stanmodel@optimizing
   * read_stan_csv uses R's functions to open files so that compressed
     files such as gzip are supported.  But a compressed file can include

Sun Oct 15 2013
1. Bug fixes
2. New features
   * add window option to traceplot
   * add all optimizers in Stan 
3. Changes
   * arguments for function stan due to the changes in Stan 2.0

May 23 2013
1. Bug fixes
   * the output csv files was using col-major order, which should be 
     row-major order 

Mar 13 2013
1. Changes
   * showing progress of sampling at the same line (using \r instead of \n)
   * plot for stanfit allows multiple pages 
2. New features 
   * add rstan:::as.mcmc.list to convert stanfit object 
     to coda object 

Fri Feb 24 2013
1. Bug fixes 
   * NA's are created when converting too large integers during data
     preprocessing
   * plot when there is an array parameter of length 1
2. New features 
   * expose a model's log_prob and grad_log_prob function 
     and add functions for transforming parameters between
     constrained space and unconstrained space
   * add a function monitor to summarize any mcmc samples given 
     as a 3-d array (# iter * # chains * # parameters)

Mon Dec  3 2012
1. New features
   * add get_posterior_mean for stanfit to obtain the posterior
     mean for all parameters
   * add optimizing for stanmodel to get MAP point estimate
2. Changes
   * include library Eigen (remove dependency on RcppEigen)

Sat Nov 24 2012
1. New features 
   * add read_stan_csv to create stanfit objects from sample CSV files 
   * introduce an as.data.frame S3 method for stanfit objects

Sun Nov  4 2012
1. Bug fixes 
   * lp__ is not included when specifying pars (issue 79) 
      https://code.google.com/p/stan/issues/detail?id=79
2. Changes 
   * change default value of arugment `permuted` from FALSE to TRUE for extract
     method of S4 class stanfit

Wed Oct 24 2012
1. New features 
   * return empty stanfit object upon error such as incorrect data
     input, wrong argument specification, etc. Previously, it will 
     stop. The empty stanfit includes the compiled model, so it can
     be reused.
   * add function stan_demo() to run examples included in Stan. 
   * add function sflist2stanfit() to merge a list of stanfit objects into one,
     to facilitate some kind of user-level parallelism. 
   * add S3 method as.matrix, as.array, is.array, dim, dimnames for stanfit objects. 
   * specify seed using string of digits in addition to numbers  
    
2. Bug fixes 
   * bug of setting parameter epsilon_pm wrongly for NUTS 

Tue Sep 25 2012
1. Changes 
   * print progress of sampling with carriage return 

2. New features 
   * add set_cppo to set c++ compiler optimization level flag 
   * support test_grad in rstan; 
     two modes --- sampling and test_grad --- for stanfit

Mon Sep  3 2012
1. Changes 
   * parameter n_chains changed to chains 
   * derive model_name from model_code or file if model_name is not specified 

Wed Aug 2012
1. Changes
   * replace dots with underscores especially in function names

Sun Aug 26 2012
1. New features 
   * get more information about the sampler such as treedepth, 
     the log-posterior back to R. 

2. Changes 
   * use underscore '_' in some output and parameter names 
   * use lower case in print of stanfit for 'Mean', etc. 

Sat Aug 25 2012
1. Bug fixes
   * deal with the case that Rcpp and rstan is 
     installed to a path with space, which causes
     the library linked to cannot be found. 

Fri Aug 24 2012
1. Changes 
   use boost 1.51.0 

Tue Aug 21 2012
1. Bug fixes
   * not working binary build for Mac (not fixed last time)
   * bug fixes in Stan

2. New features 
   * add makeconf.path function to obtain the full path for file Makeconf 
   * add Rhat legend for stanfit's plot 
   * support saving stanfit object for reusing across R sessions  
   * using <lower=, upper=> syntax for bounded variables 


Sat Aug 11 2012:
1. Bug fixes
   * plot for stanfit wide y-axis 
   * print for stanfit class 
   * not working binary build for Mac, this is because variables for 
     the path of header files are using values computed when the package is built.  

2. New features
   * add standard error of mean (SE.Mean) to print of stanfit 
   * function stan allow suing previous fitted stanfit object by adding
     parameter 'fit'
   * allow some type of interruption during sampling 
   * allow data for function stan to be specified as object names 

3. Others 
   * more documentation 
   * use GPL for License and add LicenseNote in DESCRIPTION file
