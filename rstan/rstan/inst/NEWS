Thu February 18, 2021

1. Updated to Stan v2.26.1

Fri February 5, 2021

1. Using Stan transpiler ([`stanc3`](https://github.com/stan-dev/stanc3)) to generate C++ code from Stan code.
2. Reorganized directory structure and removed redundant [`math`](https://github.com/stan-dev/math) submodule.
3. Updated the symlinks in `StanHeaders/inst/include` for the reorganized directory structure.
4. Updated the [`stan`](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan) and [`math`](https://github.com/stan-dev/math) submodules, recursively, and fixed related issues.
5. Updated the [`stan`](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan) and [`math`](https://github.com/stan-dev/math) headers.
6. Updated package dependencies.
7. Updated `StanHeaders` build script.
8. Fixed `rstan` compilation errors on Windows:
     - Addressed symlinks-related issues.
     - Defined STRICT_R_HEADERS.
11. Supported the new TBB interface.
12. Respecting `RcppParallel` flags for `rstan` plugin.
     - `RcppParallel` now supports the new interface of Intel TBB and allows using external library, including oneTBB which uses a new interface. This requires specific compiler flags to link to the correct version of TBB library.
14. Added support for `stan::io::validate_dims`.
15. Introducing a new `stanc_process()` helper function to process Stan code.
16. Updated `stanc` to print errors and return code for debugging.
17. Linking the newest version of Sundials form [`math`](https://github.com/stan-dev/math) (currently, `sundials 5.6.1`).
18. Fixed `rstan` dependency on the development version of `StanHeaders`.
19. Fixed automatic installation of `StanHeaders` in the GitHub workflows.
20. Fixed `no valid constructor` errors and rebuilt the `Rcpp` module to expose C++ classes in R.
21. Fixed Stan and C++ code preprocessing and parsing issues.
22. Fixed V8 (Embedded JavaScript and WebAssembly Engine for R) issues.
23. Fixed (possibly) invalid URLs and used HTTPS.
24. Formatted `Rcpp` module C++ code using `clang-format`.
25. Updated DESCRIPTION, bumped version, and added contributor.
26. Added support for within-chain threading.
    - A new `rsran` option `threads_per_chain` has been added to control the within-chain number of threads (`n`):
    ```r
    rstan::rstan_options(threads_per_chain = n)
    ```
    - If the model is compiled with threading support, the number of threads to use in parallelized sections _within_ an MCMC chain (e.g., when using the `Stan` functions `reduce_sum()` or `map_rect()`). The actual number of CPU cores used is `chains * threads_per_chain` where `chains` is the number of parallel chains. For an example of using threading, see [Reduce Sum: A Minimal Example](https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/reduce_sum_tutorial.html).
27. Initialize TBB arena and global control only if `threads_per_chain > 1`.
28. Linking to Boost C++ headers (BH >= 1.75).
29. Added `OpenCL` headers to `StanHeaders`.
30. Exposed stanc3 flags in `stanc` and `stan_model`:
    - `standalone_functions`: If set, the generated `C++` will be the standalone functions `C++` code.
    - `use_opencl`: If set, try to use `matrix_cl` signatures.
    - `warn_pedantic`: Emit warnings about common mistakes in Stan programs.
    - `warn_uninitialized`: Emit warnings about uninitialized variables. Currently an experimental feature.
31. Fixed `expose_stan_functions` with `stanc3`.
32. Updated and cleaned up `rstan` startup messages.
33. Updated `parse_data()` to remove trailing double underscores and invalid regex matches for working with `Eigen::Map` types.

    only one parameter (reported by ksvanhorn)
  * log_p and log_g were omitted from optimizing output when constrined
    was TRUE (reported by ksvanhorn)
2. Features
  * Should work on Windows even if CXX14 is not defined in ~/.R/Makevars
    or if ~/.R/Makevars does not exist
  * Compiler warnings are not printed to the screen by default

Mon October 09 2018
1. Bug fixes
  * Variational Bayes variable names were off-by-one in some circumstances
  * get_makefile_text() works on multiarch systems
  * The chain ID is printed in the intermediate output again
  * Low BFMI threshold is changed to 0.2 from 0.3
  
2. Features
  * Requires the C++14 standard and hence R >= 3.4.0
  * Calculates effective sample size more correctly, which can result in
    an effective sample size greater than the nominal sample size due to
    negative first order autocorrelation for some quantities of interest
  * Utilizes the pkgbuild R package
  * Specifying refresh = 0 suppresses all intermediate output
  * expose_stan_functions() uses a new, more robust procedure to generate
    the Stan code to be exposed to R
  * read_stan_csv() is faster with less memory consumed
  * unconstrain_pars() gains a NULL default to its pars argument, in which
    case the entire matrix of unconstrained parameters is returned
  * If the list of initial values passed to Stan has named elements, these
    names are retained in the output
  * There is now a loo.stanfit() method
  * HMC diagnostics can be obtained in a more programmatic way via

  * Passing a list of matrices to the data argument works again
2. Changes
  * When the sample_file and / or diagnostic_file arguments to sampling()
    were specified and the chains were run in parallel, the resulting file
    names were different than if the chains were run serially. The behavior
    in the parallel case has been changed to match the serial case; i.e. the
    file will be named "foo_#.csv" where # is the chain number rather than
    "foo.csv#". Some scripts that expect the old behavior may now be broken,
    but they should be fixed easily.

  * The chain identification number is passed to the data block as a non-negative integer called CHAIN_ID so
    it can (optionally) be utilized
