\title{Converts absolute times to intervals for wide format ctsem panel data}
\usage{
ctIntervalise(datawide, Tpoints, n.manifest, n.TDpred = 0,
  n.TIpred = 0, imputedefs = F, manifestNames = "auto",
  TDpredNames = "auto", TIpredNames = "auto", digits = 5,
  mininterval = 0.001, individualRelativeTime = TRUE,
  startoffset = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{datawide}{Wide format data, containing absolute time measurements, 
to convert to interval time scale. Otherwise as used in \code{\link{ctFit}}.  
See \code{\link{ctLongToWide}} to easily convert long format data.}

\item{Tpoints}{Maximum number of discrete time points (waves of data, or measurement occasions) 
for an individual in the input data structure.}

\item{n.manifest}{number of manifest variables per time point in the data.}

\item{n.TDpred}{number of time dependent predictors in the data structure.}

\item{n.TIpred}{number of time independent predictors in the data structure.}

\item{imputedefs}{if TRUE, impute time intervals based on the measurement occasion (i.e. column)
they are in, if FALSE (default), set related observations to NA.  
FALSE is recommended unless you are certain that the imputed value 
(mean of the relevant time column) is appropriate.  
Noise and bias in estimates will result if wrongly set to TRUE.}

\item{manifestNames}{vector of character strings giving variable names of manifest 
indicator variables (without _Tx suffix for measurement occasion).}

\item{TDpredNames}{vector of character strings giving variable names of time 
dependent predictor variables (without _Tx suffix for measurement occasion).}

\item{TIpredNames}{vector of character strings giving variable names of time 
independent predictor variables.}

\item{digits}{How many digits to round to for interval calculations.}

\item{mininterval}{set to lower than any possible observed measurement interval, 
but above 0 - this is used for filling NA values where necessary and has no 
impact on estimates when set in the correct range.  
(If all observed intervals are greater than 1, mininterval=1 may be a good choice)}

\item{individualRelativeTime}{if TRUE (default), the first measurement for each individual is 
assumed to be taken at time 0, and all other times are adjusted accordingly.  
If FALSE, new columns for an initial wave are created, consisting only of observations 
which occurred at the earliest observation time of the entire sample.}

\item{startoffset}{if 0 (default) uses earliest observation as start time.
If greater than 0, all first observations are NA, with distance of 
startoffset to first recorded observation.}

\examples{
#First load the long format data with absolute times
data('longexample')

#Then convert to wide format
wideexample <- ctLongToWide(datalong = longexample, id = "id", 
time = "time", manifestNames = c("Y1", "Y2", "Y3"), 
TDpredNames = "TD1", TIpredNames = c("TI1", "TI2"))

#Then convert the absolute times to intervals, using the Tpoints reported from the prior step.
wide <- ctIntervalise(datawide = wideexample, Tpoints = 4, n.manifest = 3, 
n.TDpred = 1, n.TIpred = 2, manifestNames = c("Y1", "Y2", "Y3"), 
TDpredNames = "TD1", TIpredNames = c("TI1", "TI2") )
 
print(wide)
